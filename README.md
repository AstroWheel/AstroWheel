#AstroWheel

All kinds of snippets and wheels for astronomers

## post regulations
0. edit the **\_posts.md** file instead of the README.md, the README.md is generated by compile.py.
1. Each post need to have a brief title start with level 2 title "## some question"
2. we can make a discription and add some meta data for this posts, like tags.
    Format of tags should be "* tags: tag1, tag2..." just follow the title in the next line
3. Then submitter start a level 4 title with his or her name "#### someone" (to make the text smaller..)
4. And the last is your content.
* the compile.py will auto generate the [**tags.md**](https://github.com/AstroWheel/AstroWheel/blob/master/tags.md) and the table of contents below,
    so make sure that you abide by this rules to make it work properly.
* you should run compile.py every time you add or delete a new post. If you do not have python, your can just leave this compiling work for others.

Here is an example post.

code:
```bash
alias rmSure=/bin/rm
alias rm=trash
trash()
{
    tempDir=~/.trash/`date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S`
    mkdir -p $tempDir
    mv -f $@ $tempDir

mv your ds9 to ds9.bin and ds9.zip to ds9.bin.zip

save the code to ds9 in the same folder as ds9.bin and chmod +x

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export XPA_METHOD=local
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
if [[ -f `echo ${@%.fits}.reg` ]]; then
	./ds9 -multiframe -lock frame image -zscale -linear -cmap gray -region shape projection $@ -region load all ${@%.fits}.reg&
else
	./ds9 -multiframe -lock frame image -zscale -linear -cmap gray -region shape projection $@&
fi
```
