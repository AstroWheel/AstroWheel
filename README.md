All kinds of snippets and wheels for astronomers

## post regulations
0. edit the *posts.md* file instead of the README.md, the README.md is generated by compile.py.
1. Each post need to have a brief title start with level 2 title "## some question"
2. we can make a discription and add some meta data for this posts, like tags.
    Format of tags should be "* tags: tag1, tag2..." just follow the title in the next line
3. Then submitter start a level 4 title with his or her name "#### someone" (to make the text smaller..)
4. And the last is your content.
* the compile.py will auto generate the tags.md and the table of contents below,
    so make sure that you abide by this rules to make it work properly.
* you should run compile.py every time you add or delete a new post. If you do not have python, your can just leave this compile work for others.

Here is an example post.

## some problems title

[//]: # (you should not change the title "## some problems title", because the compile.py need it to be this)
